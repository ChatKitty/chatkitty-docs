# Starting a user session

## 

Before a user can begin chatting with other users using ChatKitty, a **user session** must be created. A user session creates a secure bi-directional connection with ChatKitty servers allowing your users to send and receiving messages in real-time. 

ChatKitty lets you integrate your application authentication logic with no hassle.
